# AIRSpy

AIRSpy is a simple web application that displays information about the outdoor air quality of any geographical location.

## How it works

To view information about the air quality, including polluting gases, of any city, type the city name in the input field and click the search button or hit Enter on your keyboard. The app fetches the air pollution data using the coordinates of the city provided.

When the app successfully retrieves all relevant data from the API, it displays the information on the user's screen. In addition, the pollution forecast data for the next 4 days is displayed.
